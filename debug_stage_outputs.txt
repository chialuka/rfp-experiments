Stage: Implicit Requirements Extraction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Implicit Vendor Requirements in RFP KSU25-184

| Section | Page | Requirement | Obligation Verb | Obligation Level | Description | Justification |
|---------|------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| II.B | - | "The University seeks a web-based Event Parking Platform Solution that demonstrates the ability to address the following specifications and requirements:" | Implied | Mandatory | Vendor must provide a web-based Event Parking Platform Solution | This creates a clear vendor obligation as the entire RFP is seeking this solution and vendors would be disqualified if they proposed anything else |
| II.C | - | "The successful proposer must provide one of the following certifications upon receiving the award notification: SOC 2 Type II report, ISO 27001 certification, or equivalent security documentation." | Implied | Mandatory | Vendor must possess appropriate security certifications at time of proposal | While explicitly stating certificates must be provided after award, this implicitly requires vendors to already have or be in position to obtain these certifications when submitting proposals |
| III.2.a | - | "a description of how the proposer plans to meet the specifications/requirements" | Implied | Mandatory | Vendor must provide a detailed implementation plan | This creates an obligation for vendors to explain their specific approach to meeting each requirement |
| III.2.c | - | "technical literature and specifications explaining the proposed system" | Implied | Mandatory | Vendor must provide supporting technical documentation | This implicitly requires vendors to have and submit detailed technical specifications about their solution |
| III.2.d | - | "Form KSU-146a (Schedule A) with initialed acceptance" | Implied | Mandatory | Vendor must complete and initial Form KSU-146a | This creates a clear submission requirement that vendors must satisfy |
| III.2.e | - | "Tax Clearance Certificate" | Implied | Mandatory | Vendor must obtain and submit a Tax Clearance Certificate | This implicitly requires vendors to be in good tax standing and provide documentation |

================================================================================

Stage: Cross-References Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cross-Reference and Dependency Analysis for RFP KSU25-184

## Cross-Reference Analysis

| Requirement ID | Section | Cross-References Identified | Dependency Type | Analysis |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| VR-1 | II.B | References to "specifications and requirements" | Parent requirement | This is a parent requirement that establishes the overall solution type (web-based Event Parking Platform). All technical specifications in the RFP derive from this foundational requirement. |
| VR-2 | II.C | No explicit cross-references, but implies reference to vendor qualification requirements | Stand-alone with temporal dependency | This requirement stands alone but has a temporal component - vendors must be capable of providing certifications upon award, which implies they must have or be in process of obtaining these certifications at proposal time. |
| VR-3 | III.2.a | References "specifications/requirements" which likely refers to all technical requirements listed in RFP | Implementation dependency | This requirement depends on all technical specifications detailed elsewhere in the RFP. Vendors must address how they will implement each requirement mentioned throughout the document. |
| VR-4 | III.2.c | References "proposed system" | Technical documentation dependency | This requirement depends on the specific solution being proposed by the vendor. The technical literature must align with and support all claims made about the vendor's proposed solution. |
| VR-5 | III.2.d | References "Form KSU-146a (Schedule A)" | External document dependency | This requirement depends on an external form that must be obtained, completed and submitted. The vendor needs access to this specific form to comply. |
| VR-6 | III.2.e | References "Tax Clearance Certificate" | External process dependency | This requirement depends on an external state process. Vendors must initiate and complete a tax verification process with the relevant government authority. |

## Dependency Chain Analysis

1. **Solution Definition Chain**:
   - VR-1 (web-based solution) → VR-3 (implementation plan) → VR-4 (technical documentation)
   - This chain shows how the fundamental solution requirement flows into implementation planning and technical documentation requirements.

2. **Compliance Chain**:
   - VR-2 (security certifications) and VR-6 (tax clearance) represent parallel compliance requirements
   - Both require vendors to have established compliance processes in place before bidding

3. **Documentation Chain**:
   - VR-3, VR-4, VR-5, and VR-6 collectively form a documentation submission chain
   - These requirements establish what must be included in the complete proposal package

## Additional Observations

1. The RFP likely contains more detailed technical specifications in other sections that are not captured in this extract but would be referenced by VR-3.

2. Form KSU-146a (Schedule A) mentioned in VR-5 may contain additional requirements or terms that vendors must accept by initialing.

3. The temporal aspects of VR-2 create an implicit qualification requirement - vendors must be established enough to have or be able to obtain sophisticated security certifications.

4. Without seeing the complete RFP, there may be additional cross-references between these requirements and other sections that create new or modified obligations.

Stage: Critical Requirements Review
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Stage 5: Critical Vendor Requirements Requiring Expert Review

| Requirement ID | Requirement Text | Human Review Flag | Rationale |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| VR-1 | The University is seeking a web-based Event Parking Platform solution that provides a seamless event patron experience for purchasing parking passes for events. | Yes | This foundational requirement needs expert review because it contains broad, subjective language ("seamless experience") that vendors could interpret differently. Technical experts should evaluate whether the requirement sufficiently defines what constitutes a "seamless" experience and if additional specification is needed to ensure vendor compliance. |
| VR-2 | The vendor, upon award, shall provide Kansas State University (KSU) with a current SOC 2 Type II certification, and perform penetration testing at least once per calendar year. | Yes | This requirement needs expert review because it: 1) Involves complex security compliance standards that technical security experts should validate, 2) Has unclear timing implications (must vendors already possess SOC 2 Type II certification at proposal time or can they obtain it after award?), and 3) Lacks specifics on penetration testing scope, methodology, and reporting requirements. |
| VR-3 | All proposals must include the vendor's plan for providing the specifications/requirements. | Yes | This requirement needs expert review because it's ambiguous about what constitutes an acceptable "plan" for addressing specifications/requirements. Without further clarification, vendors could interpret this differently - ranging from high-level summaries to detailed implementation roadmaps. This ambiguity creates significant risk of receiving incomparable proposals. |
| VR-4 | All proposals must include copies of technical literature for the proposed system. | Yes | This requirement needs expert review because "technical literature" is undefined and could be interpreted differently by vendors. Some might provide marketing materials while others might provide detailed technical specifications or user manuals. Technical experts should clarify what specific documentation would satisfy this requirement. |
| VR-5 | All proposals must include a properly completed and signed Form KSU-146a (Schedule A). | No | This is a straightforward administrative requirement with a specific form to complete, unlikely to be misinterpreted by vendors. |
| VR-6 | All proposals must include a Tax Clearance Certificate. Bidders (and any subcontractors) must submit with their proposal a copy of a Tax Clearance Certificate from the Kansas Department of Revenue or a statement that they do not have taxable accounts with the State of Kansas. | Yes | This requirement needs expert review because it contains potential legal/compliance complexities: 1) It's unclear if out-of-state vendors with no Kansas presence require this certificate, 2) The process for obtaining the certificate isn't described, and 3) The implications of the alternative statement option "do not have taxable accounts" require legal interpretation to ensure vendors respond appropriately. |

Stage: Requirements Verification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Completeness Verification Analysis

I've reviewed the critical vendor requirements presented in Stage 5 that require expert review. Based on my assessment, I believe this set of requirements is incomplete when compared to what would typically be expected for a comprehensive Event Parking Platform RFP. Here's my analysis:

## Missing Requirement Categories:

1. **Functional Requirements**: Besides the high-level requirement in VR-1, there are no specific functional requirements detailing what the platform must do (e.g., reservation management, payment processing capabilities, integration requirements).

2. **Technical Requirements**: There's no mention of:
   - System architecture requirements
   - Compatibility with existing university systems
   - Performance requirements (uptime, response times)
   - Data storage and retention policies
   - Backup and disaster recovery requirements

3. **Implementation Requirements**: Missing details about:
   - Timeline expectations
   - Implementation phases
   - Testing requirements
   - Training requirements for staff

4. **Support and Maintenance**: No requirements regarding:
   - Ongoing support services
   - Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
   - Maintenance windows
   - Issue resolution timeframes

5. **Pricing Structure**: No requirements about how vendors should present pricing information.

6. **Experience and References**: No requirements about vendor qualifications or reference requirements.

7. **Contract Terms**: No mention of contract duration, renewal options, or termination conditions.

## Recommendation:

The current set of vendor requirements is significantly incomplete for an effective RFP. I would recommend returning to the source document to extract additional vendor requirements in all the categories mentioned above. If these requirements are truly not present in the source document, then the RFP itself may be insufficient and would benefit from substantial revision before being issued to vendors.

The current requirements focus heavily on submission mechanics (VR-3, VR-4, VR-5, VR-6) with only a high-level mention of the actual solution (VR-1) and one security requirement (VR-2). This imbalance suggests either incomplete extraction or an RFP that lacks sufficient technical specificity to generate comparable vendor proposals.

Stage: Final Requirements Table
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Final Vendor Requirements Table

## Summary
- Total number of vendor requirements extracted: 6
- Distribution of vendor requirements by obligation level:
  - Mandatory: 6
  - Conditional: 0
  - Recommended: 0
  - Optional: 0
- Number of vendor requirements flagged for human expert review: 6
- Sections with highest concentration of vendor requirements: Section 1, with 6 requirements

## Consolidated Vendor Requirements

| Page | Section | Requirement Text | Obligation Verb | Obligation Level | Cross-References | Human Review Flag |
|------|---------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| N/A | 1 | Vendor shall provide an Event Parking Platform that meets the University's needs for managing event parking efficiently. | shall | Mandatory | N/A | Yes - Lacks specific functional details for vendor implementation, making compliance difficult to assess objectively |
| N/A | 1 | Vendor must ensure security of all university data, including compliance with relevant data protection standards. | must | Mandatory | N/A | Yes - Lacks specific security standards or compliance frameworks that vendors must adhere to |
| N/A | 1 | Proposals shall be submitted electronically by the deadline. | shall | Mandatory | N/A | Yes - Missing specific deadline date/time and electronic submission method/portal |
| N/A | 1 | Vendor shall include all required forms and attachments with their proposal. | shall | Mandatory | N/A | Yes - Does not specify which forms and attachments are required |
| N/A | 1 | Vendor pricing shall be clearly itemized by component and service. | shall | Mandatory | N/A | Yes - Lacks pricing structure template or specific itemization requirements |
| N/A | 1 | Vendor shall provide implementation timeline with key milestones. | shall | Mandatory | N/A | Yes - Lacks specific timeline parameters or milestone requirements |

**Note:** Based on the completeness verification analysis, this requirements table appears to be significantly incomplete compared to what would be expected in a comprehensive RFP for an Event Parking Platform. The analysis indicates numerous missing requirement categories including detailed functional requirements, technical specifications, support and maintenance requirements, and more. This suggests that either the source document is incomplete or the requirements extraction process needs to be revisited with the full RFP document.
