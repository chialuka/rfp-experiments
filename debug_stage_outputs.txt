Stage: Implicit Requirements Extraction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Implicit Vendor Requirements for SCMPD Digital Advertising Campaign RFP (Event #4497)

| Section | Page | Requirement | Obligation Level | Directive Language | Rationale |
|---------|------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 2.1 | Not provided | Offeror must demonstrate ability to deliver quality applicants for SCMPD through advertising services. | Mandatory | Implied | The requirement that vendors "shall be evaluated on quality of applicants" implies vendors must demonstrate capabilities to deliver quality applicants, as this is a primary evaluation criterion. |
| 2.1 | Not provided | Offeror must have capabilities and experience with social media advertising targeted at interested persons. | Mandatory | Implied | The emphasis on social media advertising implies vendors must prove their capabilities in this specific area, as this is a key service requirement. |
| 2.1 | Not provided | Offeror must demonstrate previous experience with geo-fencing and keyword targeting capabilities. | Mandatory | Implied | Since geo-fencing and keyword targeting are required deliverables, vendors must demonstrate they have these technical capabilities. |
| 2.1 | Not provided | Offeror must have existing campaign tracking systems for measuring website hits, inquiries, and recruiting signups. | Mandatory | Implied | The tracking requirement implies vendors must have systems in place to perform this tracking, not just promise to deliver it. |
| 2.6 | Not provided | Offeror must develop and include a plan for achieving the 14% WBE participation goal. | Mandatory | Implied | The established WBE goal implies vendors must specifically address how they will meet this requirement in their proposal. |
| 2.2 | Not provided | Offeror must provide detailed information about current and past digital marketing services that demonstrates relevant experience. | Mandatory | Implied | The requirement to include references implies vendors must demonstrate substantive experience in digital marketing services. |
| 2.7 | Not provided | Offeror must provide evidence of technical qualifications to perform the required services. | Mandatory | Implied | The requirement to "demonstrate ability to satisfy conditions and requirements" implies vendors must provide specific qualifications evidence. |

Stage: Cross-References Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cross-Reference and Dependency Analysis for SCMPD Digital Advertising Campaign RFP

## Cross-References Identified

| Requirement ID | Source Requirement | Cross-References & Dependencies | Analysis |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|----------|
| R1 | Offeror must demonstrate ability to deliver quality applicants for SCMPD through advertising services | Cross-references: Section 2.2 (References), Section 2.7 (Qualifications) | This requirement likely connects to any references section where vendors must provide evidence of past performance and to qualification requirements where technical capabilities must be demonstrated. |
| R2 | Offeror must have capabilities and experience with social media advertising targeted at interested persons | Dependencies: R1, R3, R4 | This requirement is part of a technical capability cluster that includes geo-fencing (R3) and tracking systems (R4) that together form the complete technical solution. |
| R3 | Offeror must demonstrate previous experience with geo-fencing and keyword targeting capabilities | Dependencies: R2, R4<br>Cross-references: Section 2.2 (References) | This technical requirement likely requires evidence in a references section and works in conjunction with other advertising capabilities (R2, R4). |
| R4 | Offeror must have existing campaign tracking systems for measuring website hits, inquiries, and recruiting signups | Dependencies: R2, R3<br>Cross-references: Section 2.7 (Qualifications) | The tracking systems requirement complements other technical capabilities and likely must be addressed in the qualifications section. |
| R5 | Offeror must develop and include a plan for achieving the 14% WBE participation goal | Cross-references: Likely references forms or attachments for MWBE participation certification | This requirement likely references specific forms that must be completed regarding WBE participation and may require additional documentation of partnerships or subcontractor agreements. |
| R6 | Offeror must provide detailed information about current and past digital marketing services that demonstrates relevant experience | Cross-references: Section 2.7 (Qualifications)<br>Dependencies: Supports R1, R2, R3, R4 | This requirement likely specifies the format for providing evidence that supports technical capabilities claimed in R1-R4. |
| R7 | Offeror must provide evidence of technical qualifications to perform the required services | Cross-references: Section 2.2 (References)<br>Dependencies: Supports R1, R2, R3, R4 | This requirement provides the framework for demonstrating all technical capabilities and likely requires specific evidence formats. |

## Key Observations

1. **Integrated Technical Requirements** (R1-R4): These requirements form an interconnected cluster that collectively defines the core technical solution. Vendors must address all four in a cohesive manner that demonstrates how their capabilities work together.

2. **Evidence Requirements** (R6, R7): These requirements establish how vendors must prove their capabilities and experience claimed in R1-R4. They likely reference specific forms or attachments where this evidence must be presented.

3. **Independent Compliance Requirement** (R5): The WBE participation requirement stands somewhat independently but likely references specific forms or attachments where compliance must be documented.

4. **Documentation Chain**: There appears to be a logical flow from capability requirements (R1-R4) to evidence requirements (R6-R7) that vendors must follow to demonstrate compliance.

Without the complete RFP document, the exact cross-reference locations cannot be fully determined, but this analysis identifies the likely structural relationships between the implicit requirements that vendors must address.

Stage: Critical Requirements Review
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Stage 5: Critical Vendor Requirements Requiring Expert Review

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Human Review Flag | Rationale |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| R1 | Offeror must demonstrate ability to deliver quality applicants for SCMPD through advertising services | Yes | Contains ambiguous term "quality applicants" without clear metrics or definition. Vendors may interpret differently what constitutes a quality applicant, leading to misaligned proposals. Marketing experts should establish objective criteria. |
| R2 | Offeror must have capabilities and experience with social media advertising targeted at interested persons | Yes | Contains undefined term "interested persons" that requires clarification. Vendors may target different demographics without guidance on who constitutes the intended audience. Marketing specialists should define target audience characteristics. |
| R3 | Offeror must demonstrate previous experience with geo-fencing and keyword targeting capabilities | No | Straightforward technical requirement with commonly understood advertising terminology. |
| R4 | Offeror must have existing campaign tracking systems for measuring website hits, inquiries, and recruiting signups | Yes | Contains multiple sub-requirements that vendors might overlook. Technical specifications for the tracking system requirements aren't detailed (what level of granularity is needed for tracking each metric?). Analytics experts should define minimum tracking capabilities. |
| R5 | Offeror must develop and include a plan for achieving the 14% WBE participation goal | Yes | Requires compliance with external standards without providing specific details on plan requirements or evaluation criteria. Procurement specialists should clarify acceptable approaches to meeting this goal. |
| R6 | Offeror must provide detailed information about current and past digital marketing services that demonstrates relevant experience | Yes | Contains subjective element in determining what constitutes "relevant" experience. Vendors may misinterpret the depth and type of experience needed. Marketing specialists should establish which specific types of experience are most valuable. |
| R7 | Offeror must provide evidence of technical qualifications to perform the required services | Yes | Ambiguous about what constitutes sufficient "evidence" of qualifications. Vendors may provide inadequate documentation. Technical experts should specify acceptable forms of evidence and qualification standards. |

Stage: Requirements Verification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Verification of Requirements Completeness

After reviewing the "Critical Vendor Requirements Requiring Expert Review" table, I can confirm this represents a solid set of key vendor requirements that need special attention. However, I've identified some potential gaps that should be addressed to ensure comprehensive coverage:

## Potential Missing Requirements

1. **Performance Metrics Requirements** - While R4 mentions tracking systems, there are no specific requirements about performance guarantees or KPIs vendors must commit to achieving.

2. **Budget Allocation Requirements** - No requirements specifying how vendors should present their proposed budget allocation across different marketing channels or activities.

3. **Timeline/Implementation Requirements** - Missing specific requirements about project timelines, milestones, or implementation schedules vendors must provide.

4. **Reporting Requirements** - Beyond tracking capabilities (R4), there appear to be no specific requirements about regular reporting formats, frequency, or content.

5. **Creative Development Requirements** - No explicit requirements about the development of creative assets, messaging strategies, or brand alignment.

6. **Compliance Requirements** - Beyond the WBE participation goal (R5), there may be other compliance obligations missing (data privacy, accessibility, etc.)

## Recommendations

1. Review the source document to identify if these potential gaps exist and extract any corresponding requirements.

2. Consider adding quantitative elements to the ambiguous requirements (R1, R2, R6, R7) to make them more objectively assessable.

3. Ensure all evaluation criteria mentioned in the RFP have corresponding requirements in this or other requirements tables.

4. Check if there are any vendor-completed forms mentioned in the RFP that might contain additional implicit requirements not captured here.

The current set does capture core marketing capability requirements but would benefit from additional requirements covering the operational, financial, and administrative aspects of the vendor engagement.
