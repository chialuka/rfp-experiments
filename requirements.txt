**Note:** Based on the completeness verification analysis, this requirements table appears to be significantly incomplete compared to what would be expected in a comprehensive RFP for an Event Parking Platform. The analysis indicates numerous missing requirement categories including detailed functional requirements, technical specifications, support and maintenance requirements, and more. This suggests that either the source document is incomplete or the requirements extraction process needs to be revisited with the full RFP document.
