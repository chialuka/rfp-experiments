I understand that you're looking to create a final vendor requirements table from an RFP, but I don't have access to the actual RFP document or any previously extracted vendor requirements tables from earlier stages of your analysis.

To properly create the comprehensive final vendor requirements table as specified in Stage 7, I would need:

1. The actual RFP document text or relevant sections
2. The vendor requirements extracted in stages 2-6

Without this source material, I cannot:
- Extract verbatim requirement text
- Provide accurate page and section references
- Properly classify obligation levels
- Identify cross-references between requirements
- Flag requirements needing human expert review with specific rationales
- Generate accurate requirement counts and distributions

If you can provide the RFP document and/or the previously extracted requirements tables, I would be happy to help you create the final consolidated vendor requirements table according to your specified format and sorting criteria.
